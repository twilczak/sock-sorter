# sock-sorter

## Problem statement

We have a bunch of freshly washed socks and now it's time to sort them.

Write a function that takes a list of socks by color/pattern name and outputs the number of pairs of socks.  Example inputs and outputs follow.

Example 1:

Input: ```white red black```

Output: ```No pairs```

Example 2: 

Input: ```white pink pink white```

Output: ```white: 1 pair, pink: 1 pair```

Example 3:

Input: ```white pink pink white pink white checkered checkered checkered```

Output: ```white: 1 pair, pink: 1 pair, checkered: 1 pair```


## Running
Via node command line:
```> node index.js white red black```

Via prebuilt npm run targets (see package.json for available scripts):
``` > npm run example1```
